PRINT NUMBERS
=============

The function `print_numbers` must print on the standard output all the numbers in the input string, each on an individual line. 

Sample format of input string: "1234 425 -239"

A number is a contiguous sequence of digits (characters `0`,. . . , `9`) possibly preceded by a sign (characters `-` or `+`). The function returns the total count of numbers printed. 

Write your implementation in a file called `print_numbers.c`.
